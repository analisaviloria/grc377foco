    <h1>Freshly baked, made with love</h1>
    <h2>Located in Elk Grove, CA</h2>
    <p>Nanang Rosa was born in Tubao, La Union, Philippines on October 2, 1925 and immigrated to the United States in 1975. Whether in the Philippines or in the US, Nanang Rosa’s #1 priority was to show her love for her family and friends, and she did exactly that by cooking food! The quote that Nanang Rosa lives by is, “It’s better to give than to receive,” and that meant leaving every family party with to-go containers full of food. </br>
        Nanang, or mother in Tagalog, was the central backbone of our family and we continue her legacy through this bakery. Every single item on our menu has been derived from an original recipe made Nanang Rosa herself! So what are you waiting for? Kain na! Let’s eat!</p>
